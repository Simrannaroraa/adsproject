## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack data science application that analyzes the Netflix content library. It consists of two main parts:

1.  **A Data Science Pipeline:** A Google Colab notebook (`.ipynb`) that performs in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and builds a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict a title's content rating.
2.  **A Full-Stack Web Application:** A web app built with React and a Flask API that allows users to interact with the trained model, get AI-powered movie recommendations, and view key data visualizations.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Secure Authentication:** User login, sign-up, and logout functionality using **Firebase Authentication**.
* **Content Rating Predictor:** A form that sends user input (e.g., *type, release year, director*) to a Flask API, which returns a predicted rating from the trained ML model.
* **AI-Powered Recommendations:** A chat-like interface that connects to a generative AI to provide dynamic movie/show recommendations based on natural language queries.
* **EDA Dashboard:** An internal dashboard page displaying key visualizations (built with Plotly) from the data analysis.
* **In-Depth Analysis:** A complete Google Colab notebook showing all steps from data cleaning to model training and evaluation.

## 💻 Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend (API):** Flask, Python
* **Data Science:** Google Colab, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly
* **Authentication:** Firebase
* **BI Tool:** Power BI (for external dashboard)
